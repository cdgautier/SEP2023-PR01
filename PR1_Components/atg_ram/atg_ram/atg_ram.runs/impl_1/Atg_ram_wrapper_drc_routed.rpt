Net Atg_ram_i/op_choser_0/U0/button_state_out_3 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Atg_ram_i/op_choser_0/U0/value_out_3_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell Atg_ram_i/op_choser_0/U0/value_out_3_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Atg_ram_i/op_choser_0/U0/value_out_1_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Atg_ram_i/op_choser_0/U0/value_out_1_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell Atg_ram_i/op_choser_0/U0/value_out_1_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
